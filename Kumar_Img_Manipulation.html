                            able to successfully alter images using Python. My partner and I decided
                            to make a product that would be helpful to support education. This
                            tablet utilizes different aspects in transforming and altering an image
                            to which it is almost unrecognizable as an end product. The programming code
                            within the tablet would have algorithms that would work to benefit the user.
                            The user would be able to effortlessly create, save, and make notes within 
                            the tablet as well as utilize various tools that would be required in education
                            in the modern world. It would be a very economic investment as it focuses on 
                            maintaining a long battery life up to a week, and fast charging. These are all
                            the expectations of the product being developed. However, I worked on designing
                            the product and helping out with the code. We learned that certain code, being 
                            overused would cause a problem in how the code would run efficiently. We began to
                            utilize abstractions whenever we could, and whenever the code would refuse to run,
                            we reviewed the code and looked for solutions through the Internet and trying out
                            different types of code. I was responsible for planning the days and setting objectives
                            for each day, and ensured that each day was not ambitious and stressful.
