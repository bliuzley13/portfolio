                            <p>Hello there, my name is Arvind. Currently I am 
                            a sophomore at Dublin High School pursuing
                            a master's degree in computer science as I have an undying
                            interest in creating products from ideas. My wish is to take 
                            many coding and programming classes as possible in the 
                            future as there are many methods to make computers work for
                            numerous conveniences. In the process, seeing how Artificial 
                            Intelligence(A.I) would work alongside applications
                            in devices aiding in tasks everyday is something I deem
                            to be interesting.
                            </p>
                            <p>Normally, I am resilient and would harder if necessary.
                            But in general, I am more of an introverted, ambitious person.
                            Anything I learn at school, I would try to 
                            implement it at home. Due to homework, I tend to get very 
                            persistent, because of the fact that it could build up as
                            each day goes on. Considering how much other students
                            put into their work, I get inspired to maintain a better
                            resolve and put more effort in the work than I normally
                            provide. I like to return what I receive from others; hence
                            , I aid friends who are 'down in the dumps'.
                            </p>
                            <p>At school, actions and decisions I make proves of my 
                            responsibility. Whenever others need help, I try to stay
                            tolerable as well as being sincere in helping them from
                            not feel lower than what they could accomplish. My drive
                            is to be independent and intuitive, because depending on
                            others all the time is not always beneficial for a person.
                            Since I like challenges to compete with certain individuals 
                            that I know, I tend to become a Risk Taker. 
                            Outside school hours, I become very inclined to talk to 
                            my friends and to my peers. In my work experience at 
                            Sunshine Kids Afterschool, gaining skills such as being 
                            resourceful, persistance in my persuasive skills, and 
                            gain experience on how to use my authority diligently.
                            </p>
                            <p>At school, striving to be a professional student and 
                            be friendly at all times is my number one goal. Seeing 
                            others fail is something I can not stand. My favorite 
                            ideal is to stay very persistent in anything and not 
                            giving up or giving in until it is completely over. 
                            Aside from that, taking risks are fun since I can talk 
                            about it in front of my friends. Thank you, and look 
                            around to see what interests you.</p>
