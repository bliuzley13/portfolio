                        <p>Hello there, my name is Arvind. Currently I am 
                        a sophomore at Dublin High School. I am trying to pursue
                        a degree in programming as I have an undying interest
                        in creating products from ideas. I plan to take many
                        coding and programming classes in the future as there
                        are many methods to make computers work for certain 
                        conveniences. In the process, I would like to make and
                        see how Artificial Intelligence(A.I) would work 
                        alongside programming apps in devices that aid in tasks
                        everyday.</p>
                        <p>I am resilient, and would work harder in necessary.
                        Generally, I am more of an introverted, ambitious person.
                        In class, I am usually quiet whenever the teacher is 
                        talking. Whatever I learn at school, I would try to 
                        implement it at home. Due to  homework, I get persistent
                        , because of the fact that it would build up as school
                        days progress. I become considerate of how much work
                        other students put into, and get inspired to have better
                        resolve and put more effort in the work that I provide.
                        </p>
                        <p>Whenever I go to school, I am always responsible for 
                        my actions and decisions that I make. I am tolerant with
                        what people need help, and sincere in ensuring that they
                        do not see themselves lower than what they could 
                        accomplish. My drive is to be independent and intuitive 
                        , because depending on others all the time is not always 
                        beneficial for a person. I tend to be a Risk Taker since 
                        I like challenges to compete with certain individuals 
                        that I know. Outside of school, I become 
                        very talkative to my friends and to my peers. In my work
                        experience, I learned how to be resourceful, persistance 
                        in my persuasive skills, and gain experience on how to
                        use my authority diligently.
                        </p>
                        <p>At school, I strive to be a professional student and 
                        be friendly at all times. I am very considerate of
                        others and do not like to them fail or fall in disarray.
                        An idea that I like to have is to stay very persistent
                        in anything I try and not giving up until it is over. 
                        Aside from that, taking risks seem fun since I can talk 
                        about it in front of my friends. Thank you, and look 
                        around to see what interests you.</p>
