                            <p class="text-white float-right">In this project, the idea was to create a game where you had to control
                            the ship to touch coins, which are constantly teleporting on the screen.
                            Touching each of these coins would add to a score of zero. I learned how
                            to add images and make code that is repetitive in a sense that would help 
                            create the game as the person who owned the project under their name (collaborated 
                            with fellow groupmates) I worked on most of the project at home, and tried
                            find multiple ways to add features to the app. We, as a group, overcame 
                            problems that caused the game to crash, and made it work smoothly. My role 
                            was to provide the code to create the app and make it stable from breaking
                            down and crashing. There was code that had multiple functions, but were still
                            limited. There was limits that the app could achieve, and making a completely
                            unique product was not really possible since it had its own structure. I learned 
                            how to make it link to multiple pages and saw how it runs in a drag-and-drop
                            format. Despite failing in one aspect, the experience gained from this project 
                            indicated how certain elements could appear on the screen as if it was actually
                            running. The game worked mostly as planned, but was more prone to crashing and did not 
                            loading as fast as other applications.
