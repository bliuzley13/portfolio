                <p>In this project, the idea was to create a game where you had to control
                the ship to touch coins, which are constantly teleporting on the screen.
                Touching each of these coins would add to a score of zero. I learned how
                to add images and make code that is repetitive in a sense that would help 
                create the game as the person who owned the project under their name (collaborated 
                with fellow groupmates) I worked on most of the project at home, and tried
                find multiple ways to add features to the app. We, as a group, overcame 
                problems that caused the game to crash, and made it work smoothly. My role 
                was to provide the code to create the app and make it stable from breaking
                down and crashing.</p>
