                <p class="text-white">I worked here as a teacher's assistant. In the period of time that I volunteered there, 
                I gained many social skills from individuals of various age groups. Furthermore, I learned
                how to interact with people more comfortably and grew as a person. I began to understand
                office politics and get a glimpse of what the real world was like. Asides from the valuable
                experience, I made many friends and met so many new faces. The atmosphere was really nice, 
                and I liked to work there because of it. The place was comfortable for the students as well
                as the teachers who were there to teach the kids. My position was full of non-stop work; 
                however, this experience was essential to the fact that I got training for things in various
                aspects that saves me time.</p>
