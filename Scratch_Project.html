                <p>The main objective of this project was to provide a platformer game enjoyable for all.
                I contributed to the team by choosing what to do, and discussing if something should be changed
                or kept in the program. I learned how the program operated, based on drag-and-drop pictures.
                I saw how at times that saving before making a change is essential to debugging and revising the program.
                In Scratch, I figured out how to animate and analyze code to see that it does not conflict with each other.
                Besides learning skills like thinking step-by-step and looking ahead, I began to formulate ideas and 
                see how to make programs more smooth by removing unnecessary code. 
                Learning these skills highly compensated for a failed product that did not work as expected.
                My role was to ensure that the animation of the app was smooth and to link the different backgrounds
                together smoothly from being entirely messed up of sorts.
